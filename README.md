# Engine Sound Simulator

## What is this?

What once was a little project of mine has become a bigger piece of art where physics and sound combine to create a magnificent flow of samples which we name sound.
This is the repository of a personal project of mine that once tried to accurately simulate the sound of Internal Combustion Engines without ever leaving the Godot engine workspace.
Since I first started this project it has grown and now I'm about to rewrite everything from zero, so I decided that it would be a great idea to let everyone see this old project of mine.

## What's the condition of the project?

Ancients say that even them don't understand what is written in here. Indeed I can't guarantee that the same code that I wrote at 3 A.M. while lying to myself saying that I would soon go to sleep will be to any degree understandable.
Also, even though I've tried several times to optimize this code, it is objectively slow. GDScript isn't the right language to develop such an application so if I were to be honest it is a miracle that this is even able to simulate sound at all.

## How do I run this?

Mainly, with dreams and hopes, but you may try to start the project in the Godot Editor.
It uses both keyboard and controllers, but because I'm on Linux the inputs may be mapped in a weird way.
This is how they should be working:
Enter - start the engine
Left trigget - brake
Right trigger - gas
Left x axis - steering
right y axis - gears and clutch
right x axis - clutch
p - slow motion

Good luck if you really wanna try this...
